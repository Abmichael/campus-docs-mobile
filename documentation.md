# Campus Docs Mobile - Documentation

This document provides a general overview of the Campus Docs Mobile application, its purpose, and its main components.

## What is Campus Docs Mobile?

Campus Docs Mobile is a digital solution designed for educational institutions to streamline the process of managing and issuing official documents. It provides a user-friendly platform for students, alumni, staff, and administrators to interact with document services efficiently.

Imagine a system where:
*   **Students and Alumni** can easily request documents like transcripts, degree copies, or letters of recommendation. They can track the status of their requests in real-time.
*   **Staff members** can manage these requests, utilize pre-defined templates to generate official letters, and issue documents digitally.
*   **Administrators** can oversee the entire system, manage user accounts, and view audit logs to ensure everything is running smoothly.

This application aims to reduce paperwork, speed up processing times, and provide a convenient experience for everyone involved.

## Key Features

*   **User Roles:** The system has distinct interfaces and functionalities tailored to different types of users:
    *   **Students/Alumni:** Can submit new requests for documents and track their existing requests.
    *   **Staff:** Can process requests, generate letters using templates, and manage issued documents.
    *   **Administrators:** Have oversight of the system, including user management and access to system settings and audit trails.
*   **Letter Templates:** Staff can create and manage templates for various official letters. These templates can include placeholders (like `{{student_name}}` or `{{date_of_issue}}`) that are automatically filled in when a letter is generated, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
*   **Request Workflow:** A clear workflow allows students to submit requests, staff to process them, and for the status of these requests to be tracked throughout.
*   **Digital First:** While it can support traditional paper processes, the system is designed to facilitate digital document generation and management.

## Technical Components

The Campus Docs Mobile system is composed of two main parts:

1.  **The Mobile Application (Client):**
    *   This is the app that users (students, staff, administrators) will interact with on their mobile devices.
    *   It's built using Flutter, a modern framework for creating applications that run smoothly on both Android and iOS devices from a single codebase.
    *   It handles user login, displaying information, submitting forms, and communicating with the backend server.

2.  **The Backend API (Server):**
    *   This is the "engine room" of the system. It runs on a server and is responsible for:
        *   Storing all the data (user accounts, requests, letter templates, etc.).
        *   Handling the logic for user authentication (making sure users are who they say they are).
        *   Processing requests from the mobile app (e.g., saving a new document request, fetching a list of templates).
    *   It's built using Node.js and Express.js, which are popular technologies for creating efficient web servers.
    *   For data storage, it currently uses LowDB, a simple database that stores information in a JSON file. This is great for getting started quickly and can be replaced with a more robust database system as the application grows.

## How They Work Together

When a user performs an action in the mobile app (like logging in or submitting a request), the app sends a message to the backend API. The API processes this message, interacts with the database if necessary (e.g., to save the request or check login details), and then sends a response back to the mobile app. The app then updates what the user sees based on this response.

This separation between the mobile app (what the user sees and interacts with) and the backend API (the central brain and data store) is a common and effective way to build modern applications.
